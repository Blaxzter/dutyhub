    returning a fresh closure per call site.

    This reaching-in is fragile by nature, so it is written once here rather
    than at the four call sites it used to be spelled out at. If ``deps.py``
    ever stops using the ``Annotated[..., Depends(...)]`` shape, this function

    Three identity dependencies survive the self-service refactor:
    ``CurrentUser``, ``AnyUser`` and ``CurrentSuperuser``. Everything that used
    to be a global manager role is now a per-event membership, so tests grant
    access by inserting an ``EventMembership`` rather than by swapping a
    dependency.

    Identity is pinned here rather than authenticated: the point of a route
    test is the route, and making all ~500 of them mint and present a real
    token would test ``deps.py`` five hundred times over. The real credential
    path has its own coverage — ``tests/api/test_deps.py`` for the dependency
    and ``unauthenticated_client`` below for the endpoints that must work
    without one.

    ``AnyUser`` is pinned alongside ``CurrentUser`` and not left to run for
    real. It is a *separate* closure, so leaving it out meant the two endpoints
    that use it (``GET`` and ``DELETE /users/me``) answered 401 to an otherwise
    perfectly ordinary route test, with nothing in the failure naming the
    reason. Only ``CurrentSuperuser`` still denies by default, because that one
    is a genuine authorisation boundary rather than a question of who is
    calling.

    # REQUEST BACK. This override yields the savepoint-wrapped ``db_session``
    # with no such context manager, so writes made on the way to an error
    # response survive here and do not survive in production.
    #
    # That difference already hid one real bug: refresh-token reuse detection
    # revoked every session and then raised 401, and the 401 rolled the
    # revocation back — invisible to a passing test, found only by driving a
    # live server. ``logic/auth/tokens.py`` now commits explicitly before
    # raising. If you write a route that must persist something *and* return an

    Here the identity dependencies run for real, so a request without an
    ``Authorization`` header is genuinely anonymous and a request with one is
    resolved by ``decode_access_token`` — see the ``auth_headers`` fixture for
    minting the latter.
