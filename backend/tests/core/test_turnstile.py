"""Tests for the Cloudflare Turnstile check (app.core.turnstile).

The one property worth testing here is that it **fails closed**. A verifier
that returns True when it cannot reach Cloudflare is worse than no verifier at
all: it looks like protection, and it stops protecting at precisely the moment
somebody is attacking the thing it guards. So most of what follows feeds
``verify_turnstile`` a different kind of broken and asserts the same False.

The network is stubbed with ``httpx.MockTransport`` rather than by replacing
``verify_turnstile``'s internals — the real client still parses the reply,
still applies ``raise_for_status``, and still raises the real exception types,
which is what makes "a 500 from siteverify is a rejection" a meaningful claim
rather than a restatement of the stub.
