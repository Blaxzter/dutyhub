"""Unit tests for authentication dependencies.

``app.api.deps`` is the only place in the application that turns a credential
into a ``User``. Everything downstream — roles, ``EventMembership``,
``logic.permissions`` — trusts whatever comes out of here, so the tests below
are deliberately paranoid about the *negative* cases: an expired token, a token
signed with the wrong key, a token naming an account that has since been
deleted, and a token that is simply absent.

Two things this file used to test are gone with the identity provider. There is
no just-in-time provisioning any more (an account exists because someone
registered it, so an unrecognised ``sub`` is a credential for nothing rather
than an invitation to create a row), and there is no profile sync on login
(``email_verified`` is now this application's own flag, moved by its own
verify-email flow). The ``X-Test-User-Email`` branches deliberately survive: the
Playwright suite authenticates through them because in CI the browser origin and
``VITE_API_URL`` are genuinely cross-site, which silently drops the httpOnly
refresh cookie a real login depends on.
