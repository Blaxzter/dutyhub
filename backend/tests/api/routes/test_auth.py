"""End-to-end tests for the endpoints that hand out and take away credentials.

These are written against HTTP rather than against ``app.logic.auth`` because
in this corner of the application the transport *is* half the behaviour. A
login that returns the right body but forgets the ``HttpOnly`` flag, a refresh
that rotates the row but not the cookie, a logout that clears a cookie at the
wrong path — every one of those is a real bug that a service-level test cannot
see. So each test here drives ``unauthenticated_client``, which runs the whole
dependency chain for real: no ``CurrentUser`` override, no impersonation
header, a genuine ``Authorization: Bearer`` and a genuine cookie jar.

Three mechanics are worth knowing before reading further:

* **The raw tokens exist only in flight.** Both token tables store a sha256, so
  a test cannot read a verification or reset secret back out of the database.
  The ``outbox`` fixture below intercepts the mails the routes schedule, which
  is the only way to follow a link the way its recipient would.
* **``other_client`` is a second browser**, not a second user. Its own cookie
  jar is what makes "this device" versus "my other devices" testable at all —
  and that distinction is the entire point of session revocation.
* **Status codes carry meaning.** 401 means "prove who you are", 403 means "not
  allowed", and 404 — for a session belonging to somebody else — means "you
  cannot even see this", matching ``logic.permissions.require_event_visible``.
  Asserting the ``auth.*`` code alongside the status is what pins the
  frontend's ``errorCodes`` translations to something real.
