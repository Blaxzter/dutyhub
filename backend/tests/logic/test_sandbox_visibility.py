"""A demo belongs to exactly one account, and the superadmin is not it.

That sentence is the whole invariant, and it is unusual enough to be worth
spelling out: everywhere else in this application the platform superadmin is
the account that can see anything. Here they deliberately cannot. A sandbox is
a stranger's throwaway data, seeded by an anonymous visitor with no agreement
of any kind; putting it in the admin event list would show one visitor's made-up
rota to an operator whose only available action on it is to break it.

The invariant is not enforced in one place. It is enforced in about a dozen —
every listing query that a superadmin can run without an event filter, plus the
one gate every read of a single event goes through. Each of those is a separate
opportunity to forget, so this file is one test per guard, named after it, and
each one is paired with the positive case: the demo's own guest still sees
their demo. A guard that hid the sandbox from everybody would pass the negative
half and leave the visitor staring at an empty app.

Two things to know about how these are driven:

* **The guest's perspective goes through ``unauthenticated_client``** with the
  real access token their sandbox was handed. There is no identity override for
  a guest, and inventing one would test the override.
* **The organiser screens are reached by promoting the guest's membership**
  rather than by seeding ``role="manager"``, which currently raises — see
  ``_promote_to_owner`` and the xfails in ``test_sandbox_seed.py``.
