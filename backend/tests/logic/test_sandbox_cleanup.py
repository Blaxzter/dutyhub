"""Taking a demo away again — the half of the feature that keeps the promise.

This file exists because ``purge_sandbox`` can fail *silently*. Its deletion
order is load-bearing, and getting it wrong raises nothing: it leaves rows
behind that no longer belong to any event. Two foreign keys are responsible.
``tasks.event_id`` is ``ON DELETE SET NULL`` with no delete-orphan cascade, so
deleting the event first orphans its tasks rather than removing them; and
``events.created_by_id`` is ``ON DELETE CASCADE``, so deleting the guest first
deletes the event underneath, firing that SET NULL before any Python runs.

An orphaned task has ``event_id = NULL``. Every scope filter in this
application is built from ``event_id IN (...)``, and a NULL matches no ``IN``
list — so such a row escapes every one of them, forever, with no owner left who
could delete it. That is why the assertions here are not "the event is gone"
but a census: a count per table, plus a global sweep for rows whose parent
pointer went NULL while we were not looking.

The tests build their demos through the real seeder (see
``tests/fixtures/sandbox.py``), because the shapes that get orphaned are
exactly the ones a hand-rolled fixture would forget to create.
