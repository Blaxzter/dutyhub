"""Taking a demo away again — the half of the feature that keeps the promise.

Read this before changing anything here: **the deletion order is load-bearing**,
and getting it wrong does not raise. It leaves rows behind that no longer belong
to any event, and a row with a NULL ``event_id`` slips through every scope
filter in the application, because those filters are all built from
``event_id IN (...)`` and a NULL matches no ``IN`` list. The failure mode is not
a crash; it is a stranger's demo shift showing up in a real user's search
results, permanently, with no owner who could delete it.

Two foreign keys cause that:

* ``tasks.event_id`` is ``ON DELETE SET NULL`` (``models/task.py``) and
  ``Event.tasks`` carries no ``delete-orphan`` cascade. Deleting the event on
  its own therefore *orphans* its tasks rather than removing them, and with the
  tasks go their shifts and everyone's bookings on them.
* ``events.created_by_id`` is ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` (``models/event.py``).
  Deleting the guest first therefore deletes the event underneath us at the
  database level, which fires the SET NULL above before any Python runs.

Hence: children first, the event next, the guest accounts **last**. And hence
``Task.is_sandbox`` exists as a denormalised column — belt and braces, so that
an orphan produced some other way is still excluded from every listing.

Nothing here commits. ``api.deps.get_db`` owns the transaction boundary, so a
purge that fails half way rolls back whole rather than leaving the very mess
this module exists to prevent.
