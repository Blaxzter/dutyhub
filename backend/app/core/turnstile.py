"""Cloudflare Turnstile verification for the open, unauthenticated forms.

Registration is the one endpoint a stranger can call as often as they like and
have something to show for it afterwards: a row in ``users``, a message sent to
whatever address they typed, and a name that shows up in every event's member
picker. ``app.core.rate_limit`` caps how *fast* that can happen, but it cannot
tell a person from a script — a bot that registers five accounts an hour and
then waits is inside every ceiling this codebase has.

Turnstile is the missing half. The browser solves a challenge, the form carries
the resulting token, and this module asks Cloudflare whether that token is one
it actually issued.

Three decisions worth keeping:

* **Enforcement is opt-in, on the secret alone.** It runs only when
  ``TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`` is set, so local development, the test suite and any
  deployment that has not signed up for Turnstile yet keep working unchanged.
  Deliberately *not* gated on ``ENVIRONMENT`` as ``emails_enabled`` is: a
  staging deployment that has the key configured should be exercising the real
  path, not a stub.

* **It fails closed.** A missing token, a rejected token, a malformed reply and
  an unreachable ``siteverify`` all return False. The tempting alternative —
  treat "Cloudflare is unreachable" as "must be human" — turns an outage into
  an open door, and hands an attacker who can *cause* that outage the choice of
  when the door opens.

* **``remoteip`` is deliberately not sent.** It is optional, and when it *is*
  sent Cloudflare requires it to match the address that solved the challenge.
  The only address available here is ``client_ip``'s reading of
  ``X-Forwarded-For``, and on a dual-stack client the browser routinely solves
  the challenge over IPv6 and posts the form over IPv4 (or the reverse), which
  would compare two genuinely different addresses and reject a real person.
  The token is already bound to the client that solved it; the extra parameter
  buys little and its failure mode is "nobody can register", diagnosed from a
  bare ``success: false``.
