"""A small in-process rate limiter for the authentication endpoints.

Login, registration and password reset are the three routes an attacker gets to
call as often as they like, so they are the three that need a ceiling:
credential stuffing, mass account creation and reset-email flooding are all
"same request, many times" attacks.

**What this is honestly worth.** The counters live in a plain dict in the
process that serves the request. ``backend/Dockerfile`` starts the API with
``fastapi run --workers 4``, and each of those four worker processes gets its
own dict — so a limit of "10 per 5 minutes" is really "10 per 5 minutes *per
worker*", i.e. up to 40 in the worst case where the OS spreads an attacker's
requests evenly. Restarting the container resets every counter, and a second
API replica would double the ceiling again.

That approximation is deliberate. The stack has no Redis (``docker-compose.yml``
runs db, adminer, prestart, backend, frontend, mailcatcher and nothing else) and
a Postgres-backed counter would put a write on the hot path of every login,
including the ones that fail. A 4x-loose limit still turns an unthrottled
credential-stuffing run into a rounding error; if that stops being enough, the
replacement is a shared store behind the same ``RateLimiter.check`` call, not a
cleverer dict.

**Disabled under ``settings.TESTING``.** The Playwright suite runs six workers
in parallel against one backend, all logging in as a handful of seeded users
from a single IP. Any sane per-IP limit trips within seconds and surfaces as
random 429s in unrelated specs — a bug that reads as flakiness. The unit tests
in ``tests/core/test_rate_limit.py`` flip the flag off explicitly so the counting
logic itself is still exercised.
