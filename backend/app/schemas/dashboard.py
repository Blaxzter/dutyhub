"""Shapes for the /app/home dashboard.

The dashboard used to hand the browser three date ranges and let a calendar
work out what they meant. Nothing on it answered the two questions somebody
actually opens it for — *am I due anywhere?* and *where are people still
missing?* — so these schemas carry answers instead of raw rows: every shift
arrives with the job it belongs to, where to turn up, and how full it is.
