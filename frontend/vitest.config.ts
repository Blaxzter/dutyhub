       * The distribution here is bimodal, not a bell curve: every file that has
       * a spec is at 100% (717/717 statements), and three have no spec at all.
       * Averaging those into one aggregate number would describe an accident of
       * history rather than any file, let a PR pay for deleting one store's
       * tests by covering something else, and only move when someone remembers
       * to raise it. A per-file floor answers the two questions a PR actually
       * raises: did this file get worse, and is this new file tested?
       *
       * 90 rather than 100 because the covered set is at 100% today — ten points
       * is headroom for a branch that is genuinely awkward to reach, not slack
       * for shipping untested code. Raise it when that stops being true.
       *
       * ── Why the globs look like this ──────────────────────────────────────
       * The three modules below have no spec yet. They cannot be given their
       * own `0` threshold entry as an exception, because vitest checks a
       * glob-matched file against the *global* thresholds as well ("Global
       * threshold is for all files, even if they are included by glob
       * patterns"). So there is no global entry at all; each covered area
       * carries the floor and names its own exceptions with `!(…)`.
       *
       * The exceptions are subtractions from a rule, so they stay inside the
       * coverage `include` and keep showing up at 0% in the report — the debt
       * stays visible instead of being excluded into silence. And because the
       * patterns are `**`-rooted, a *newly added* file anywhere under these
       * directories is matched, reported at 0% and fails. Deleting a name from
       * a `!(…)` list is the ratchet; the lists should only ever shrink.
