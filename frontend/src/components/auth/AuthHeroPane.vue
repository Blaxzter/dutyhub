/**
 * The pitch beside the auth forms — and, below `lg`, a slim branded band.
 *
 * A visual sibling of `SelectEventHeroPane`: same `--hero` surface, same
 * `--hero-speck` glows, same inverted logo, same proof-point tiles. It is
 * deliberately *not* a verbal sibling — `duties.selectEvent.visual.*` is still
 * written in the older formal register, and everything under `auth.` is "du".
 *
 * Two things the sibling does not do. The glows are separate layers here and
 * drift, slowly enough to be felt rather than watched; and the copy arrives
 * rather than appearing, staggered down the pane.
 *
 * On a phone all of that collapses to a 56px band with the wordmark in it. A
 * headline, a subhead and three tiles is some 320px of argument stacked on top
 * of the first input, and the person on this screen has already decided — they
 * came here to sign in, not to be sold to.

      with the arrow keys — no `tabindex` attribute involved. This pane
      overflows on an ordinary laptop (it fits at 1440x900 but not at 1280x720),
      so without this a Tab past the footer would land focus inside an
      `aria-hidden` subtree: a big focus ring around the marketing column and a
      silent stop for anyone using a screen reader. `-1` keeps it scrollable by
      wheel and pointer while taking it back out of the tab sequence.
