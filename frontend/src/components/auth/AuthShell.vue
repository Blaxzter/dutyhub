/**
 * The frame every public auth screen sits in.
 *
 * Two columns from `lg`: the pitch on `--hero`, and the form on the page
 * background with nothing drawn around it. The card is gone on purpose — a card
 * says "this is one thing among several on a page", and there is nothing else
 * on this page. Bare, with room around it, the form *is* the screen.
 *
 * The form comes first in DOM order and the hero is placed with
 * `lg:order-first`. That is not a style preference: the E2E suite asserts that
 * exactly one Tab press separates the email field from the password field, and
 * that at most fifteen stops precede the email field. Ordering the DOM
 * form-first means the pane can grow as many links as it likes without ever
 * costing a tab stop. It also keeps the `<h1>` ahead of the pane's `<h2>`, so
 * heading order reads correctly.
 *
 * The legal links and the language and appearance controls live here rather
 * than in each view: these screens sit outside the pre-auth shell that normally
 * carries them, and somebody who cannot read "Passwort vergessen?" has to be
 * able to change the language *before* signing in.

    `min-h-svh` rather than `min-h-screen`: `100vh` on a phone resolves to the
    height with the browser toolbar *retracted*, so the form starts a toolbar's
    worth below the fold and a centred column sits visibly low. `svh` is the
    small viewport — constant for the session, and a `min-` so nothing clips.
    On `lg` there is no dynamic toolbar, so the two-pane frame is a fixed
    `h-dvh` and each column owns its own scroll.
